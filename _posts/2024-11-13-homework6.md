# The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus and Its Relationship to Density Functions and CDFs

## The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (FTC)

The **FTC** bridges differentiation and integration. It states:

$$\int_a^b f(x) \, dx = F(b) - F(a)$$

where $$ f(x) $$ is a continuous function on $$[a, b]$$, and $$ F(x) $$ is an antiderivative of $$ f(x) $$ (i.e., $$ F'(x) = f(x) $$).

This fundamental relationship plays a crucial role in probability theory, particularly in connecting **probability density functions (PDFs)** with **cumulative distribution functions (CDFs)**.

---

## Key Definitions

### 1. **Probability Density Function (PDF)**
A PDF, \( f_X(x) \), describes the relative likelihood of a random variable \( X \) taking a specific value. For a **continuous random variable**, the probability of \( X \) lying in an interval \([a, b]\) is given by:

$$P(a \leq X \leq b) = \int_a^b f_X(x) \, dx.$$

The total area under the PDF over the entire domain equals 1, ensuring a valid probability distribution.

### 2. **Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)**
A CDF, \( F_X(x) \), gives the probability that \( X \) takes on a value less than or equal to \( x \):

$$F_X(x) = P(X \leq x) = \int_{-\infty}^x f_X(t) \, dt.$$

The CDF accumulates probabilities over the interval \((-\infty, x]\).

---

## Relationship Between PDF and CDF

Using the **FTC**, we see:

1. **The CDF is the integral of the PDF:**
   $$F_X(x) = \int_{-\infty}^x f_X(t) \, dt.$$

2. **The PDF is the derivative of the CDF (if \( F_X(x) \) is differentiable):**
   $$f_X(x) = \frac{d}{dx} F_X(x).$$

This relationship highlights how the FTC provides the mathematical foundation for understanding the connection between these two functions.

---

## Interpretation

1. The **PDF** describes the *instantaneous rate of change* of the **CDF**. At any point \( x \), \( f_X(x) \) measures how quickly the probability \( P(X \leq x) \) is accumulating.
   
2. The **CDF** aggregates probabilities over the range \((-\infty, x]\), while the **PDF** focuses on the density of probability at each specific \( x \).

---

## Example: A Specific PDF and CDF

Consider a random variable $$\( X \)$$ with the PDF:

$$
f_X(x) = 
\begin{cases} 
2x & \text{if } 0 \leq x \leq 1, \\
0 & \text{otherwise}.
\end{cases}
$$

### Step 1: Finding the CDF

The CDF \( F_X(x) \) is found by integrating \( f_X(x) \):

$$
F_X(x) = \int_{-\infty}^x f_X(t) \, dt.
$$

Breaking this into cases:

$$
F_X(x) = 
\begin{cases}
0 & \text{if } x < 0, \\
\int_0^x 2t \, dt = t^2 \big|_0^x = x^2 & \text{if } 0 \leq x \leq 1, \\
1 & \text{if } x > 1.
\end{cases}
$$

Thus:

$$
F_X(x) = 
\begin{cases}
0 & \text{if } x < 0, \\
x^2 & \text{if } 0 \leq x \leq 1, \\
1 & \text{if } x > 1.
\end{cases}
$$

### Step 2: Verifying the PDF

Taking the derivative of \( F_X(x) \) confirms the PDF:

$$
f_X(x) = \frac{d}{dx} F_X(x) = 
\begin{cases}
2x & \text{if } 0 \leq x \leq 1, \\
0 & \text{otherwise}.
\end{cases}
$$

## Summary

- The **CDF** accumulates probabilities, while the **PDF** provides the rate at which these probabilities change.
- The **FTC** provides the theoretical framework linking these two functions in probability theory, ensuring consistency and coherence in their definitions and applications.
