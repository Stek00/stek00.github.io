## Welford’s recursion

Welford's recursion, also known as Welford's online algorithm, is a method for computing the variance and mean of a set of numbers in a single pass through the data.

The algorithm works as follows:

1.  Initialize variables: 
    
    $$
    M_1 = x_1 \text{ (first value)}, S_1 = 0, \text{ and } n = 1
    $$
    
2. For each new value xₖ, update:

$$
n = n + 1 \\

M_n = M_{n-1} + \frac{x_n - M_{n-1}}{n} \\

Dev_n = Dev_{n-1} + (x_n - M_{n-1}) \cdot (x_n - M_n)

$$

After all values are processed, the mean is Mₖ and the variance is Devₖ / (k - 1)

This method is numerically stable and efficient, making it ideal for streaming data or large datasets where storing all values is impractical.

We can also show how to derive the formula above:

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{N} \left( x_i - \bar{x}_N \right)^2 - \sum_{i=1}^{N-1} \left( x_i - \bar{x}_{N-1} \right)^2 = \left( x_N - \bar{x}_N \right)^2 + \sum_{i=1}^{N-1} \left( \left( x_i - \bar{x}_N \right)^2 - \left( x_i - \bar{x}_{N-1} \right)^2 \right) \\= \left( x_N - \bar{x}_N \right)^2 + \sum_{i=1}^{N-1} \left( \left( x_i - \bar{x}_N + x_i - \bar{x}_{N-1} \right) \left( \bar{x}_{N-1} - \bar{x}_N \right) \right) \\= \left( x_N - \bar{x}_N \right)^2 + \left( \bar{x}_N - x_N \right) \left( \bar{x}_{N-1} - \bar{x}_N \right) \\= \left( x_N - \bar{x}_N \right) \left( x_N - \bar{x}_N - \bar{x}_{N-1} + \bar{x}_N \right) \\= \left( x_N - \bar{x}_N \right) \left( x_N - \bar{x}_{N-1} \right)
$$

Which gives the formula to update the variance at every iteration.


## Application in C#

[The source code for the application can be found here](https://github.com/Stek00/stek00.github.io/tree/main/Homework_2)

In this homework the previous application was refined and new features were added.

Firstly there was the implementation of the Random Walk, that was simply added using an else block, as shown below:

- C# Code for Random Walk Implementation
    
    ```csharp
    else
    {
        PointF end = new PointF(position.X, position.Y + lineh); // go down
        graph.DrawLine(p, position, end);
        position = end;
        score--;
    }
    ```
    

The rest of function is the same as the one posted in the previous homework.

Secondly there was the implementation of the absolute and relative frequency trajectories of the scores of every hackers. Below can be found the code of the relative frequency trajectories implementation, the absolute one uses the same approach used for the random walk so it won’t be shown it this page, but can be found in the source code.

- C# Code for Relative Frequency Trajectories
    
    ```csharp
      private void drawRelative(Graphics graph, List<int> hackerScores, int servers, double prob, float linew)
      {
          float height = relativeGraph.Height;
    
          Random rnd = new Random();
          Pen p = new Pen(Color.FromArgb(rnd.Next(256), rnd.Next(256), rnd.Next(256)));
    
          PointF position = new PointF(0f, height);
          float score = 0f;
    
          for (int j = 0; j < servers; j++)
          {
              // Calculate the relative score by dividing the hacker score by (j + 1)
              score = hackerScores[j] / (float)(j + 1);
    
              PointF end = new PointF(position.X, height * (1 - score));
    
              graph.DrawLine(p, position, end);
    
              // Update the position to the end of the vertical line
              position = end;
    
              PointF next = new PointF(position.X + linew, position.Y);
    
              graph.DrawLine(p, position, next);
    
              // Update the position for the next iteration
              position = next;
          }
      }
    ```
    

It follows the same concept as the random walk and the absolute trajectories graph, but instead of jumping 1 unit everytime now we jump the number of successes / number of attempts, so the final graph will have only values between 1 and 0.

Lastly there was an addition regarding the distribution of the scores and the implementation of the mean and variance using the Welford’s *Online* Algorithm. The implementation of both this new features are shown below.

- C# Code for Score Distribution
    
    ```csharp
      private void DrawKSample(Graphics graph, int hackers, float servers, List<int> partialScores, float height, float width)
      {
    
          var semiBlack = Color.FromArgb(128, Color.Black);
    
          Pen pen = new Pen(Color.Red);
    
          var g = partialScores.GroupBy(i => i).OrderBy(group => group.Key);
          float half = height / 2;
          int n = partialScores.Distinct().Count();
    
          var m1 = partialScores.GroupBy(i => i).OrderByDescending(group => group.Count()).First().Count();
    
          graph.DrawLine(pen, servers * width, 0f, servers * width, graphBox.Height);
          float scoreHeigth = (graphBox.Width*0.7f - servers * width) * 0.6f / (float)m1;
          foreach (var grp in g)
          {
              SolidBrush blackBrush = new SolidBrush(semiBlack);
    
              float yPosition = graphBox.Height / 2 - height * grp.Key - half;
              RectangleF rect = new RectangleF(servers * width, yPosition, scoreHeigth * grp.Count(), height*2f);
              graph.FillRectangle(blackBrush, rect);
    
          }
      }
    ```
    
- C# Code for Welford's Online Algorithm Implementation
    
    ```csharp
    private (double, double) Variance_Mean(List<int> scores)
    {
        double mean = 0;
        double oldM;
        double variance = 0;
        int i = 1;
    
        foreach (double score in scores)
        {
            oldM = mean;
            mean += (score - mean) / i;
            variance += (score - mean) * (score - oldM);
            i++;
        }
    
        variance = variance / (scores.Count - 1);
    
        variance=Math.Round(variance, 2, MidpointRounding.AwayFromZero);
        mean = Math.Round(mean, 2, MidpointRounding.AwayFromZero);
    
        return (variance, mean);
    }
    ```
    

The last lines are used to round the result up to 2 decimals and avoid showing a large numbers of them. This also show the efficiency of the algorithm and its prevention to catastrophic cancellation.

## Research

Across all the graphs I observed that they tend to follow the same pattern. Every time I increase the probability of success the distribution tends to converge towards it ( i.e. if p=0,8 it tends to converge towards the higher part of the Y-axis, if p=0,2 it tends to converge to the lower part of the Y-axis), and this happened to every graph, both absolute and relative.

The main difference between absolute number of successes and the relative one isn’t that big. Mainly the relative one assumes high relative value in the start and then tends to stabilize towards the end to the probability value more or less. The absolute one instead just grows considering the fact that we only plot the successes, while the failures are plotted as 0, and even in this case we observe that trajectories tend to converge to the value of the probability.
