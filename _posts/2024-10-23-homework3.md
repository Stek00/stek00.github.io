# Theory

## Illustrate formally, in the simplest possible way, why the Median is the minimum c f the sum of |x(i) - c| (sum of absolute deviations).

While the mean minimizes the sum of squared deviations from a dataset, the median minimizes the **sum of absolute deviations**. In this homework, we will formally demonstrate that the median of a dataset minimizes the sum of absolute deviations.

Given a dataset  $$x_1,x_2,...,x_n$$ we aim to find the value $$c$$ that minimizes the following sum:

$$
S(c) = \sum_{i=1}^{n}|x_i-c|
$$

We can observe that above expression represents the sum of the absolute distance between a central point c and each data point $$x_i$$ in the dataset.
The absolute value function $$|x_i - c|$$ depends on whether c is less than or greater than $$x_i$$. Specifically
- if $$
c \le x_i ,|x_i-c|=x_i-c
$$

- if $$
c\ge x_i, |x_i-c|=c-x_i
$$

To determine the value $$c$$ that minimizes $$S(c)$$, we need to analyse the derivatives of the sum, observing how the behaviour of $$S(c)$$ changes as c move past each data point. 

We can achieve this in a mathematical way computing the derivative of $$S(c)$$:

$$
\frac{d}{dc} S(c) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{d}{dc} |x_i - c|
$$

The derivative of the absolute value function 
$$
|x_i-c|
$$ is:

$$
-1\ \ if \ \ c<x_i \ \ and \ \ +1 \ \ if \ \ c>x_i
$$

We can also consider it as the difference between the Number of $$x_i$$’s greater than $$c$$ - Number of $$x_i$$’s less than $$c$$. At the median this difference will be zero proving that the median minimizes the sum of the absolute deviations.

## Find all possible different conceptual different ways to define a "location" statistics (sometime also called "center" or "central tendency") or synthesis of a distributions. Showing how the generalization of these ideas can potentially lead to infinite other definitions.

In statistics, a location statistic or measure of central tendency seeks to summarize a dataset by pinpointing a common or central value where data points gather. The conventional central tendency metrics (mean, median, mode) are widely utilized, yet the idea can be extended in numerous ways. In this homework, we will examine different methods for defining the concept of "location" and demonstrate how they can result in a limitless range of definitions depending on the characteristics and objectives of the analysis.

### 1. **Arithmetic Mean (or Mean)**

- **Definition:** The arithmetic mean is the sum of all observations divided by the number of observations.

$$
\text{Mean} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i
$$

- **Concept:** The mean balances all data points and minimizes the sum of squared deviations from the central value. It is sensitive to outliers.

### 2. **Median**

- **Definition:** The median is the value that divides the dataset into two equal halves, with 50% of the observations below and 50% above.

$$
\text{Median} = x_{\left( \frac{n+1}{2} \right)}
$$

- **Concept:** The median minimizes the sum of absolute deviations from the central value. It is robust to outliers.

### 3. **Mode**

- **Definition:** The mode is the most frequent value in the dataset.

$$
\text{Mode} = \arg\max_{x_i} \, \text{Frequency}(x_i)
$$

- **Concept:** The mode identifies the value that appears most often. It is useful for categorical data and distributions with repeating values.

### 4. **Geometric Mean**

- **Definition:** The geometric mean is the nth root of the product of all data points.

$$
\text{Geometric Mean} = \left( \prod_{i=1}^{n} x_i \right)^{\frac{1}{n}}
$$

- **Concept:** The geometric mean is useful for data that are multiplicatively related, such as growth rates.

### 5. **Harmonic Mean**

- **Definition:** The harmonic mean is the reciprocal of the arithmetic mean of the reciprocals of the data points.

$$
\text{Harmonic Mean} = \frac{n}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{1}{x_i}}
$$

- **Concept:** The harmonic mean is appropriate when data points represent rates or ratios.

### 6. **Trimmed Mean**

- **Definition:** A trimmed mean is the mean of the dataset after removing a certain percentage of the lowest and highest values.

$$
\text{Trimmed Mean} = \frac{1}{n - 2k} \sum_{i=k+1}^{n-k} x_i
$$

where k represents the number of trimmed values.

- **Concept:** It reduces the effect of outliers while still incorporating most of the data.

### 7. **Weighted Mean**

- **Definition:** A weighted mean assigns weights to each data point and calculates the mean accordingly.

$$
\text{Weighted Mean} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i x_i}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i}
$$

- **Concept:** This allows for the inclusion of additional information on the importance of different data points.

## Generalizations Leading to Infinite Possibilities

The above examples illustrate that there are already many ways to define a central tendency depending on the context and the properties we wish to emphasize. These definitions can be generalized further, leading to **infinite potential central tendency measures**. Here are some ways to extend these ideas:

### Minimization of General Loss Functions

We can generalize the concept of a "center" by considering different loss functions to be minimized. For instance, while the mean minimizes the sum of squared deviations and the median minimizes the sum of absolute deviations, any other loss function $$f(x_i,c)$$ could define a new center:

$$
S_f(c) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} f(x_i, c)
$$

By choosing different forms for $f$, such as exponential loss, Huber loss, or any non-linear form, we can define infinitely many new measures of central tendency.

The only change in this implementation is the fact the we now don't consider servers and their probability to penetrate a server but we have a value lambda.

            }
