# Statistical Independence: Concepts and Formal Definitions

Statistical independence is a key concept in probability theory, describing when two events do not influence each other. Below, weâ€™ll go over the formal definition, illustrate the concept with examples, and draw analogies to help with understanding.

## 1. Formal Definition of Independence

Two events $$ A $$ and $$ B $$ are statistically independent if the probability of both events occurring together is equal to the product of their individual probabilities. Formally:

$$
P(A \cap B) = P(A) \cdot P(B)
$$

This equation implies that knowing $$ A $$ has occurred gives no information about whether $$ B $$ has occurred. If instead $$( P(A \cap B) \neq P(A) \cdot P(B) )$$, then the events are dependent, meaning the occurrence of one affects the likelihood of the other.

### Example

Suppose we flip two fair coins. Define:
- $$ A $$: the event that the first coin lands on heads.
- $$ B $$: the event that the second coin lands on heads.

Since each coin flip is independent of the other, the probability of both coins landing on heads is:

$$
P(A \cap B) = P(A) \cdot P(B) = 0.5 \cdot 0.5 = 0.25
$$

## 2. Visualizing Independence

A helpful way to visualize independence is through diagrams that represent probabilities as areas.

1. **Independent Events**: If $$ A $$ and $$ B $$ are independent, the area of their overlap (representing $$( P(A \cap B) )$$) should be proportionate to the product of the areas (probabilities) of $$ A $$ and $$ B $$.
   
2. **Dependent Events**: If $$ A $$ and $$ B $$ are dependent, the overlap area may be larger or smaller than $$( P(A) \cdot P(B) )$$. For instance, if the occurrence of $$ A $$ makes $$ B $$ more likely, the overlap will be larger.

## 3. Analogies for Independence

Here are some real-world analogies to clarify independence:

- **Dice Rolls**: Rolling a die and flipping a coin are independent events because the outcome of one does not affect the other.
- **Weather and Lottery**: The probability of rain on a given day and the outcome of a lottery draw are independent; one has no effect on the other.

## 4. Conditional Independence

For three events $$ A $$, $$ B $$, and $$ C $$, we say $$ A $$ and $$ B $$ are conditionally independent given $$ C $$ if:

$$
P(A \cap B | C) = P(A | C) \cdot P(B | C)
$$

This means that, given $$ C $$ has occurred, $$ A $$ and $$ B $$ do not influence each other.
