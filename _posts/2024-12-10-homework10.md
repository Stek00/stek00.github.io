# Sampling Mean, Variance, and Lebesgue–Stieltjes Integration

## Sampling Mean and Variance

In statistics, the **sample mean** and **sample variance** are fundamental quantities used to estimate population parameters. The sample mean, denoted by \( \bar{X} \), is the arithmetic average of observed values and serves as an **unbiased estimator** of the population mean \( \mu \). According to the **Law of Large Numbers**, \( \bar{X} \) converges to \( \mu \) as the sample size increases, improving estimation accuracy.

The **sample variance**, denoted by \( S^2 \), measures data dispersion around the mean. It is computed using a correction factor \( n-1 \) to ensure an **unbiased estimate** of the population variance \( \sigma^2 \). When the data follows a normal distribution, the sample mean follows a **normal distribution** with variance \( \sigma^2/n \), while the scaled sample variance follows a **chi-squared distribution** with \( n-1 \) degrees of freedom. These properties underpin many statistical methods, including hypothesis testing and confidence interval estimation.

## Lebesgue–Stieltjes Integration: A Bridge Between Measure Theory and Probability

**Lebesgue–Stieltjes integration** extends classical integration by associating a measure with a monotonic function. While the **Riemann integral** sums function values over subintervals, the **Lebesgue approach** integrates functions with respect to more general **measures**, providing greater flexibility.

In **probability theory**, this integration method is crucial for defining expectations of random variables. A **cumulative distribution function (CDF)** induces a measure, allowing integration with respect to probability distributions rather than length. This approach seamlessly handles **continuous, discrete, and mixed distributions**, offering a rigorous foundation for probability calculations.

Beyond probability, in **measure theory**, Lebesgue–Stieltjes integration allows integration against **any measure**, not just the Lebesgue measure. This generalization is useful for studying irregular functions, fractals, and other mathematical structures where classical methods are inadequate.

## Summary

- **Sampling Mean and Variance:** The sample mean \( \bar{X} \) is an **unbiased estimator** of \( \mu \), converging to it as sample size increases. The sample variance \( S^2 \) is an unbiased estimate of \( \sigma^2 \), and their distributions are well understood, particularly under normality assumptions.

- **Lebesgue–Stieltjes Integration:** This technique extends integration by allowing measures induced by **non-decreasing functions**, such as CDFs. It plays a key role in **probability theory**, defining expectations rigorously, and in **measure theory**, generalizing integration beyond traditional limits.

These concepts provide a robust mathematical foundation for **statistics and probability theory**, supporting applications that require precise modeling of randomness and uncertainty.
