# Basic Notions of Statistics

### Population

A **population** is any complete group with at least one characteristic in common. Populations are not just people. Populations may consist of, but are not limited to, people, animals, businesses, buildings, motor vehicles, farms, objects or events.

### Statistical Unit

A **statistical unit** is the basic element or individual entity in a statistical population that is being studied or measured. It is the fundamental object of observation in a statistical investigation.

The choice of statistical unit depends on the specific study or analysis being conducted. It's important to clearly define the statistical unit at the beginning of any statistical investigation to ensure accurate data collection and analysis.

### Distribution

A **distribution** refers to how the values of a variable or dataset are spread. It illustrates the frequency or probability of different outcomes occurring within the data, helping to identify patterns by showing how data points are spread across various possible values.

Here are some examples of common random distributions in statistics:

- **Normal Distribution (Gaussian Distribution):** A symmetrical, bell-shaped curve centered around the mean. It's often used to model natural phenomena and measurement errors.
- **Binomial Distribution:** Models the number of successes in a fixed number of independent trials, each with the same probability of success.
- **Poisson Distribution:** Used for modeling the number of events occurring within a fixed interval of time or space, assuming these events happen with a known average rate.
- **Exponential Distribution:** Often used to model the time between events in a Poisson process, such as the time between arrivals in a queue.

### Frequency

In statistics, **frequency** refers to the number of times a particular value or category occurs within a dataset. It is a fundamental concept used to summarize and describe data.

There are three main types of frequency:

- **Absolute Frequency:** The actual count of how many times a specific value appears in a dataset.
- **Relative Frequency:** The proportion of times a value occurs, usually expressed as a fraction or percentage of the total observations.
- **Percentage Frequency:** The relative frequency expressed as a percentage. It is calculated by dividing the frequency of a particular value by the total number of observations and multiplying by 100.

It is often represented visually using various tools such as frequency tables, histograms, and bar charts, which help in understanding the distribution of data and identifying patterns or trends.

# Notion of arithmetic average

The arithmetic average, also known as the mean, is a fundamental concept in statistics. It is calculated by summing up all the values in a dataset and dividing by the number of values.

The formula for the arithmetic average is:

$$
\bar{x} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i}{n}
$$

The arithmetic average is widely used because it takes into account all values in a dataset and provides a measure of central tendency. However, it can be sensitive to extreme values or outliers in the data.

## Derivation

In statistics, derivation refers to the process of mathematically deriving or deducing formulas, properties, or relationships from fundamental principles or existing statistical concepts. It involves using mathematical reasoning and logic to establish new statistical methods or prove existing ones.

Derivations are important in statistics because they help in understanding the underlying principles of statistical methods, validating their correctness, and sometimes leading to new insights or more efficient computational approaches.

## Computational problems with floating point representation

Floating-point errors are a common challenge in computational geometry algorithms, where precision is crucial for accurate geometric calculations. These errors can arise due to the inherent limitations of representing real numbers in a finite binary format. 

Floating-point numbers in computers are represented using a finite number of bits, leading to the inability to precisely represent certain real numbers. This limitation introduces rounding errors, leading to inaccuracies in calculations.

Some key computational problems associated with floating-point representation:

- **Rounding errors:** Floating-point numbers can only represent a finite subset of real numbers, leading to rounding errors when performing calculations.
- **Catastrophic Cancellation:** When subtracting two nearly equal numbers, the most significant digits may cancel out, leaving only the less significant (and less accurate) digits.

To mitigate these problems, various techniques such as arbitrary-precision arithmetic, interval arithmetic, or symbolic computation may be employed, depending on the specific requirements of the algorithm.

Donald Knuth is not specifically known for proposing entirely new **numerical methods** in the traditional sense. Instead, Knuthâ€™s work focuses on **algorithmic efficiency, precision**, and the practical implementation of algorithms in the context of numerical computation.
