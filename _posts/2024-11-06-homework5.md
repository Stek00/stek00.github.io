# Proof of Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality

## Statement
The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality in summation form states:
$$\left(\sum_{i} a_ib_i\right)^2 \leq \left(\sum_{i} a_i^2\right)\left(\sum_{i} b_i^2\right)$$

##  Proof

1) For any real number t, consider the quadratic expression:
  $$\sum_{i} (a_i + tb_i)^2 \geq 0\\$$ 
  (since sum of squares is always non-negative)

2) Expand this:
  $$\sum_{i} (a_i + tb_i)^2 = \sum_{i} (a_i^2 + 2ta_ib_i + t^2b_i^2)\\$$
  $$= \sum_{i} a_i^2 + 2t\sum_{i} a_ib_i + t^2\sum_{i} b_i^2$$

3) Let's call:
  $$A = \sum_{i} a_i^2\\$$
  $$B = \sum_{i} b_i^2\\$$
  $$C = \sum_{i} a_ib_i\\$$

4) Our quadratic in t is:
  $$At^2 + 2Ct + B \geq 0$$ for all real t

5) Since this quadratic is always non-negative, its discriminant must be â‰¤ 0:
  $$(2C)^2 - 4(A)(B) \leq 0$$

6) Simplify:
  $$4C^2 - 4AB \leq 0\\$$


  $$C^2 \leq AB$$

7) Therefore:
  $$\left(\sum_{i} a_ib_i\right)^2 \leq \left(\sum_{i} a_i^2\right)\left(\sum_{i} b_i^2\right)$$

# Practice

The image below represents the updated interface of the program. Now it is possibile to select the desired simulation and by inserting the required fields we can get the simulation with both the distribution, either the end distribution or the one at time K, and the mean and variance at the end of the simulation or at the time K.
